This site is used to redeem your voucher. Shop on the site, drop item(s) into your shopping cart, then check-out in the normal fashion.
</br>
During check-out, you will have an opportunity to use your voucher. On this site, it's called a "GIFT CERTIFICATE", so please enter your voucher number into the "Gift Certificate Redemption" box, then click "Apply". Your total will be automatically updated to reflect the value of your voucher.
</br>
If your total becomes 0, all you need do is click on "Process Order" at the bottom of the check-out screen. If, however, you still have a positive balance, you may pay the remaining portion with any credit card we accept.
</br>
If you have any difficulty with this site or questions, please contact Customer Service, see the "Contact Us" link for our contact information.

Thanks,
The Classic Group
